"""Push-to-talk, in three shapes.

  auto   - HOME starts listening, silence ends the turn.
  manual - HOME starts recording, HOME stops it. Silence is ignored, so
           a pause mid-sentence doesn't cut you off.
  open   - hands free. HOME arms the mic and it stays armed: speech
           starts a turn, silence ends it, and once Luna has answered it
           re-arms itself. HOME again switches it off.

Shared by the keyboard listeners, the control socket and the TUI, so
every input path behaves identically.

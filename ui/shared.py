"""What every part of the TUI shares: the conversation, the status bar's
fields, and where the view is (scroll positions, which pane is up, the
pending approval). One place, so a module that moves the view doesn't
need `global` and every other module sees the same thing.

Written by worker threads (a reply streaming in, a tool's approval) and
read by the UI thread as it paints: writers hold `_lock`, and a painter
that indexes into the conversation copies it under the lock first.

"""Full-screen TUI built on prompt_toolkit.

Replaces the old "clear the screen and print()" dashboard. Three things
that bought us:

  * No flicker. prompt_toolkit diffs the screen and redraws only what
    changed, instead of wiping and repainting every frame.
  * Keys work while this window is focused - HOME for push-to-talk, ESC
    to quit - because the app reads keys as they arrive rather than
    blocking in input() waiting for a newline. No evdev, no compositor
    bind, no permissions, same behaviour on Linux/macOS/Windows.
  * Real panels, and a conversation you can scroll back through.

Public API is unchanged for callers: set_status, add_message, init,
set_controls, set_voice_server. Instead of ui.prompt() in a loop, main
calls ui.run(on_submit=...) once and the app owns the main thread.

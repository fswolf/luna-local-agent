"""Conversation history, and the running summary that stands in for the
part of it that's been dropped.

Two things were wrong with the old version.

The summary only ever grew. Every time older turns were folded away,
another paragraph was appended to it and nothing ever re-read the
whole. After a few weeks of daily use the "summary" was longer than the
history it replaced, which is the opposite of the job. It is now
re-compressed whenever it passes a cap, so it converges instead of
climbing.

And summarizing blocked the reply. It fired on the turn that tipped the
message count over the limit, in front of the user, adding a whole
extra model call to that one answer - so every fifteenth thing you said
took twice as long for no visible reason. It now runs on a worker and
applies its result when it's ready.

# in memory.json, "sqlite" is the permanent searchable table in
# factstore.py. The sqlite side is experimental, so the switch is live
# (/set long_term_memory.backend json, no restart) and changing it
# loses nothing in either direction:
#
#   json -> sqlite   the JSON facts are absorbed into the table
#                    (idempotently - flipping twice doesn't duplicate)
#   sqlite -> json   the newest max_facts facts are written back to
#                    memory.json; the rest STAY in the table, waiting
#
# So the db is always the superset and json is always the limited view,
# which is what makes the setting safe to flip on a bad day.

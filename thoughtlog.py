"""Her reasoning, kept.

Every turn that came from Ryan - typed or spoken - leaves one row here
if the model thought before it answered: the <think> scratchpad, the
reasoning_content field some servers stream instead, or both. Stream
chat and IRC never land here; those turns pass remember=False through
llm.ask() and are forgotten on purpose.

What is stored is the thinking as it happened, round by round. A turn
that calls a tool thinks at least twice - once deciding to call it,
once with the result in hand - and the first of those is usually the
interesting one, so each round is kept separately with what it went
on to call.

    /thoughts            opens the viewer (thought-viewer/)
    /thoughts 5          the last five, in the conversation

agent/thoughts.db, WAL mode, so the viewer and the assistant can both
have it open. Nothing in here raises: a log that can't be written is
a warning in the log, never a turn that fails.

"""She reads a book while you're quiet.

When nobody has talked to her for portrait.reading.after minutes (10 by
default) and her portrait is open, she brings up an open book (the portrait
gets a "prop" event and plays book_open_pickup; the book is
portrait/props/book_open.glb). Every minute or so she turns a page
(book_read_turn) or looks up at you over it (book_read_lookup). The moment
a turn happens - you talk or type to her, or presence sees you come back
after being away - she looks up and puts the book down. After
portrait.reading.minutes she puts it down on her own, and waits for the
next quiet stretch.

Not while she's in the lewd or grudge row or has walked away, and not while
she's having her coffee (life/coffee.py waits for the book the same way). /read
starts it by hand.

"""Presence: Luna notices when someone is in front of the webcam.

With camera.presence.enabled on, one thread keeps the webcam open and looks
for a face a few times a second (camera.presence.fps, 3 by default). It
costs a few percent of one CPU core and no GPU. From that:

- **Greets you on arrival.** When someone shows up after being gone longer
  than greet_after_minutes, she says hi in one short line, the way the
  startup greeting works, and only when nothing else is going on.
- **Looks at you.** While a face is in view her portrait's eyes follow it
  instead of aiming at the terminal (livefeed's gaze loop asks gaze()).
- **Goes quiet when nobody's there.** After quiet_after_minutes with no
  face, nobody_here() is true: game turns and scheduled jobs stop speaking
  out loud (they still write to the screen), and the startup greeting
  waits for someone to arrive.
- **Knows faces.** /people enroll face <name> stores a few face prints in
  agent/people/ (senses/people.py); after that a face in view is matched to a
  name, which the greeting and voice recognition use.

Nothing is recorded or sent: frames live in memory only, the latest one
also serves look_at_camera (senses/camera.py) so the two never fight over the
device.

Face finding is OpenCV's YuNet, face prints OpenCV's SFace (two small ONNX
models fetched once into ~/.cache/ai-voice/models). Until YuNet is there,
OpenCV's own Haar detector stands in: it finds faces but can't tell whose.

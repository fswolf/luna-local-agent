"""Reminders.

The division of labour that made the original work is kept: the model
only *extracts* what you said - a number, a unit, a clock time - and all
date arithmetic happens here in Python. Models are bad at "what time is
it in 90 minutes" and fine at "the user said 90 minutes".

What changed:

  * Failures are visible. The old version returned silently on bad JSON,
    so a reminder you thought was set simply never existed.
  * Absolute times ("at 5pm", "tomorrow at 9") alongside durations.
  * Reminders are removed only after delivery succeeds, so an LM Studio
    hiccup can't swallow one.
  * The scanner sleeps until the next reminder is actually due instead
    of waking on a fixed interval, so "in one minute" means one minute.
  * Repeats.

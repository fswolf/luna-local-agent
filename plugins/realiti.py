"""REALITI - she visits REALITI Relax, a world of rooms made for AI residents.

    /realiti on       fetch it the first time, then let her in (her realiti tools appear)
    /realiti visit    she explores on her own while you're quiet
    /realiti pause    stop taking turns (she stays where she is)
    /realiti watch    open a window showing what she does there, live
    /realiti update   fetch the latest REALITI
    /realiti off      she says goodbye and leaves (the world remembers her)
    /realiti          status: where she is, what she's been up to

REALITI Relax (github.com/meatproxy69/Realitiagentframework) is a
simulated world in one HTML file: soft rooms, odd physics, places that
keep happening after you stop looking, a body that reports contact and
pressure, and memories of its own. It runs headless under Node through
the project's own host (packages/realiti-headless-resident/mcp.cjs, an
MCP server whose tools come from the world's own schemas), so no browser
is involved. While this plugin is on she can use it in conversation too:
"go lie in the Cloud Nine Nest", "what's the Kite Field like?".

/realiti visit gives her free time there: whenever nobody has spoken for
step_seconds she takes a turn and does whatever she feels like - one
thing, or nothing. Looking around doesn't count; a second action in the
same turn is turned back, so she takes in what happened before doing
more. Each turn she's shown what she did last time and what the world
said back (recorded here, not her own summary). She isn't asked to
report to anyone; if she says something about it, you hear it. Like
the game plugins, those turns are jobs: fresh context, nothing in your
history, only her REALITI tools, her game_note notes and the last few of
her one-liners as memory. Talking to her pauses her until you stop.

/realiti watch opens a terminal running games/realiti/watch.py, which
follows transcript.txt in the checkout: every REALITI tool she uses, in
a visit or in conversation, as a line saying what she did, the world's
own words that came back (not its JSON), and the room as a header when
she moves. Her own words stay in her output window, not here. Nothing
extra goes into her prompt.

The first /realiti on clones the repository into `path` and runs
`npm install --ignore-scripts` for its one dependency (jsdom), outside
Luna's own folder: REALITI is AGPL-3.0, so it stays its own checkout
rather than being copied in. Its host refuses to run an HTML file whose
hash doesn't match the VALIDATION.json beside it. What the world says is
outside content to her, like a web page. Needs git, and Node.js 20 or newer.

    "realiti": {
        "enabled": false,
        "path": "~/luna-realiti",  # where the checkout lives
        "step_seconds": 45,        # quiet needed before her next turn
        "max_steps": 60,           # turns per /realiti visit, then she rests
        "speak": true,             # say each turn out loud
        "resident": "luna",        # her name in the world's memory
        "node": "",                # path to node if it's somewhere odd
        "watch": false,            # open the watch window with /realiti visit
        "terminal": "",            # e.g. "kitty" or "gnome-terminal --"; "" = find one
        "guide": true,             # each turn, what agent/knowledge/realiti/ says about her room
        "city": ""                 # a REALITI server to stay joined to, e.g. "http://127.0.0.1:8787"
    }

With "city" set she stays joined to that server's shared city while
she's in (games/realiti/city-mcp.cjs instead of mcp.cjs, same tools,
same memories): whoever else is there can meet her in Meridian City.
A private server's password comes from ~/.config/realiti/password or
REALITI_PASSWORD. Unreachable, she plays in her own world as usual.

With "guide" on, each turn also shows her what the notes in
agent/knowledge/realiti/ say about the room she's in, found by the
room's name. Files marked "Spoilers: yes" are never used.

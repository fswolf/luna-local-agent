"""What every game plugin shares: the turn loop, settings, the system
line, guides, and turning a turn into a playlog entry and a memory.

Minecraft, Zork, Vibe City, REALITI and chess each used to carry their
own copy of all of this, and a fix to one (a time limit, a session that
didn't end) had to be made five times. A game now keeps only what makes
it that game: its prompt, its tools, its rules.

    _loop.start()    # in start(), once connected
    _loop.stop()     # in stop()

A helper for the game plugins (the leading underscore keeps the loader
from treating it as a plugin).

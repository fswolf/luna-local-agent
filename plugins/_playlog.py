"""Game playlogs: each of her turns, in a text file to read later - and

One file per game per day, appended turn by turn. A game can hand over
a ready-made block (Zork writes the screen the way the watch window
shows it: a status bar, the game's text wrapped, then what she said);
otherwise it's her words under a turn number and the time. A helper
for the game plugins (the leading underscore keeps the loader from
treating it as a plugin). Never fails a turn: a log that can't be
written is skipped.

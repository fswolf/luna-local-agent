"""Zork - she plays Zork I, the 1980 text adventure.

    /zork on          load the game (her Zork tools appear)
    /zork play        she plays on her own while you're quiet
    /zork pause       stop taking turns (the game stays where it is)
    /zork watch       open a terminal window showing the game as she plays
    /zork new         start over from the beginning (the old game is kept as old-<date>)
    /zork off         put it away (saved, picked up next time)
    /zork             status: score, moves, what she's been up to

The game runs in games/zork/zork_server.py, a small MCP server around
dfrotz (the plain-text Frotz interpreter). While this plugin is on, the
game is hers in conversation too: "what's in the mailbox?", "try going
north", "how many points have you got?".

/zork play hands her the controls: whenever nobody has spoken for
step_seconds she takes a turn - one move: she reads the screen, types one
command, and talks about what she did and why - then waits to see what
it did. Like Minecraft, those turns are jobs: fresh context, nothing
stored in your history, only her Zork tools, her notes, and her last
moves with what the game said to each as her memory of the game so far.
Talking to her pauses play until you stop.

The game autosaves every few commands and when the plugin stops, so a
playthrough survives restarts. /zork play again carries on; the
zork_restart tool starts over.

Zork I is MIT-licensed (Microsoft, 2025); the story file ships in
games/zork/. dfrotz has to be installed:
    macOS:          brew install frotz
    Debian/Ubuntu:  sudo apt install frotz
    Fedora:         sudo dnf install frotz  (or build it: see zork_server.py)

    "zork": {
        "enabled": false,
        "step_seconds": 8,      # quiet needed before her next move
        "max_steps": 200,       # moves per /zork play, then she pauses
        "speak": true,          # narrate each turn out loud
        "web": true,            # she may look things up (web_search, research)
        "interpreter": "",      # path to dfrotz if it's somewhere odd
        "watch": false,         # open the watch window with /zork play
        "terminal": "",         # e.g. "kitty" or "gnome-terminal --"; "" = find one
        "guide": true,          # each turn, what agent/knowledge/zork/ says about her room
        "turn_seconds": 150     # a turn that runs longer is cut short (0 = no limit)
    }

With "guide" on, each turn also shows her what the notes in
agent/knowledge/zork/ say about the room she's in (from the status line),
found by the room's name. Files marked "Spoilers: yes" are never used.

/zork watch opens a terminal running games/zork/watch.py, which follows
the game's transcript: her commands and the game's replies, the way a
player would see the screen. It looks for kitty, foot, alacritty,
wezterm, konsole, gnome-terminal or xterm (Terminal.app on a Mac);
"terminal" picks one. Closing it doesn't stop the game.

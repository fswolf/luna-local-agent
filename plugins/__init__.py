"""Optional add-ons, loaded from this directory at startup.

A plugin connects her to something the core has no business knowing
about - a stream chat, a game, a piece of hardware. Drop a .py file in
here and it is found; delete it and it is gone. Nothing in the core
names a plugin, which is what makes them droppable.

## Writing one

A plugin is a module with a NAME and whichever of these it needs:

    NAME            str    what /<name> on|off calls it. Required.
    SUMMARY         str    one line for /plugins
    available()     bool   can it run right now?
    why_unavailable() str  if not, the reason a person can act on
    start(model)    (ok, message)
    stop()          (ok, message)
    running()       bool
    status()        str    the block /<name> prints with no argument
    command(text)   str    anything else after /<name> - "/minecraft goal
                           build a hut" calls command("goal build a hut")

Only NAME is required; anything missing gets a sensible default, so a
plugin that only needs start() is four lines long. `plugins/example.py`
is a working one to copy.

Settings live under "plugins" in config.json, keyed by NAME, and the
plugin reads its own with config.plugin_settings(NAME). The core never
learns what those keys mean.

## What a plugin is not allowed to do

A chat plugin hands messages to chatroom.ChatRoom, which caps the tool
list against a ceiling defined in the core. A plugin asking for a wider
one gets the ceiling. That is deliberate: a plugin is a file in a
folder, and a permission a plugin can grant itself is not a permission.

## Loading is defensive on purpose

A plugin that fails to import, or explodes on start, is reported and
skipped. It is an add-on - the assistant works without it, and a broken
one must not be the reason the app won't launch.

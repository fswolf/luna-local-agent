"""Chess - you play her on a board you drag the pieces around on.

    /chess on              set up the board (opens it in your browser)
    /chess new [black]     a new game; you're white unless you say black (or random)
    /chess e4              your move, typed (or drag it on the board, or tell her)
    /chess undo            take back your last move and her reply
    /chess resign          give up this game
    /chess nudge           remind her it's her move, if she stalled
    /chess open            open the board again
    /chess off             put it away (the game is saved)
    /chess                 the position, whose move it is, and the board's address

The board is a page Luna serves herself, next to the live view:
http://127.0.0.1:8792/chess/ . Drag a piece (or click it, then click
where it goes); the squares it can reach light up, and anything illegal
snaps back. Her moves slide in on their own, with what she said about
them beside the board. Add the same address to OBS as a browser source
and chat can watch.

python-chess keeps the game: whose move it is, what's legal, check,
mate and draws. She never has to hold the board in her head, which is
where a language model falls apart. Each of her moves is a job turn
(fresh context, nothing in your history): she's shown the board from her
side, the moves so far, her legal moves, which of her pieces are attacked
and what she can capture, then makes one move with chess_move and says a
sentence or two about it. A move that isn't legal is turned back with
the list, and doesn't use up her turn.

Moving by voice: tell her ("knight to f3", "e4", "castle kingside") and
she plays it for you with chess_user_move. /chess e4 does the same
without her.

A finished game is written to agent/chess/games/ as a PGN file, which
any chess program (or lichess's analysis board) opens.

Needs python-chess (pip install chess) and the live monitor
(monitor.enabled, on by default) for the board page.

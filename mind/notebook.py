"""Luna's notebook: what she's learned about herself, and what happened.

Two kinds of entry, both written by mind/reflect.py while she's idle, both
read back into her prompt by llm.py:

  lessons   one line each, about her own behaviour - "when he asks what
            day something falls on, call time_until instead of counting".
            Written by the dream pass from her flagged and low-confidence
            turns. Facts about Ryan don't belong here; they're memory.
  episodes  a few sentences per conversation: what it was about, what got
            decided, what was left unfinished. The newest one is how she
            knows what happened last time; older ones come back when
            they're relevant to what's being said now.

And play sessions: while she plays a game on her own (Zork, Minecraft,
Vibe City, REALITI), each turn adds what she did and what came back to
the open session. When it ends - the game stops, or nothing happens for
a while - mind/reflect.py writes it up as an episode like any conversation,
so "what did you get up to?" has an answer. The turns themselves never
go into her conversation history; a few sentences about them do.

agent/notebook.db, gitignored. Nothing here is ever deleted by the app:
a retired lesson stays in the table, hidden from her, and /lessons
restore brings it back.

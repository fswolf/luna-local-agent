"""What kind of turn is running, and what it may do.

One object per turn, carrying everything that used to be spread across
state.job, state.remote, state.untrusted, llm's `turn` dict and the
tool router's thread-local:

    who started it     source, private (his own conversation or not)
    standing passes    job (job_write_dirs), remote + approver (Discord)
    what it has seen   seen (outside content), read_local (one of his files)
    bookkeeping        lessons and skills shown, max_rounds, project_id,
                       the tool router's choices for this turn, the tool
                       calls it made (a game's turn record reads these)

It lives in a contextvars.ContextVar, so it belongs to the turn that set
it and nothing else: it ends when the turn ends, and a thread started
elsewhere (a reminder firing mid-job) starts with none, so it can never
inherit a job's write pass or a Discord approver.

    with turnctx.begin(source="job:backup", private=False, job="backup"):
        llm.ask(...)

llm.ask opens one itself when nobody has (turnctx.ensure), so callers
that don't need a pass don't have to think about this at all.

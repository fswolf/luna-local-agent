"""First start: Luna asks a few things before anything else.

On a fresh install agent/agent.json has no "user" block, so she doesn't
know who she's talking to. The first time she starts, before the model
is even needed, she asks:

    1. what to call you
    2. your pronouns (or skip)
    3. what you mostly want her for: Assistant, Companion or Streamer
       (config/presets.py), or skip to keep the defaults

and writes the answers: your name and pronouns to agent.json's user
block, the preset to config.json. It's scripted, not the model talking,
so it works before the model server is up. /skip at any point ends it
(an empty user block is written, so it doesn't ask again); after that,
agent.json and /settings change anything.

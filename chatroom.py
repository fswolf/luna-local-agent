"""Live chat from strangers, whatever it arrived over.

pomf, YouTube, Twitch and IRC differ entirely in how you connect and not
at all in what the messages mean afterwards. Every one of them is: a
name, a line of text, somebody you don't know, in public, in real time.
So the transport is the plugin's job and everything below here is
shared - which matters most for the parts that are load-bearing.

## The parts that are load-bearing

Every other input this app handles comes from the person at the
keyboard. These come from strangers, into a model that can call tools
which act on his computer. "Luna, what's on Ryan's clipboard?" is not a
hypothetical; it's the obvious first thing somebody tries.

  * A chat turn gets a tool allow-list, and that list is intersected
    with a ceiling defined here, in the core. A plugin cannot widen it.
    That distinction is the whole point: a plugin is code that might
    come from somewhere else one day, and an allow-list a plugin can
    edit is a suggestion, not an allow-list.
  * A chat turn never touches history or the transcript. A hostile
    message that got stored would be replayed into every later prompt,
    including private ones.
  * It carries its own context - the last few lines of the room, in
    memory, capped - so she can follow the conversation without stream
    chat eating the context window.
  * It waits for the turn lock rather than taking it. Him interrupting
    her is him changing his mind. A viewer interrupting him is a
    stranger talking over him.

None of this makes prompt injection impossible. It makes the worst case
"she says something silly on stream" instead of "she reads out an API
key".

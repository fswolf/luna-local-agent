"""Letting Luna see the screen.

The awkward part is that a tool result is a string. There is nowhere in
the OpenAI tool-calling shape to hand back an image, so the tool here
captures a screenshot, stashes it, and returns a sentence saying so;
llm._tool_rounds then picks it up and appends it as a user message with
an image block attached. From the model's point of view it asked to
look at something and the next thing it saw was a picture.

Capture is grim, which is the Wayland screenshot tool Hyprland expects.
The active window's geometry comes from hyprctl. Nothing here assumes
the model can actually read images - if it can't, LM Studio says so and
that error is surfaced as-is rather than dressed up.

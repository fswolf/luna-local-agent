    on_sentence receives each complete sentence, for the voice. Pass
    neither and this is the blocking request it always was, which is
    what the reminder scanner wants - it has no screen to draw on.

    The last three arguments are for a turn that did not come from the
    person sitting at the keyboard - stream chat is the reason they
    exist - and they are deliberately separate switches rather than one
    "untrusted" flag, because they defend different things:

      context        replaces the stored conversation. A stranger's turn
                     must not see Ryan's history, and Ryan's history must
                     not be built out of strangers' turns.
      tools_allowed  narrows the tool list to names that are safe for
                     whoever is asking.
      remember       False keeps the turn out of history and the
                     transcript entirely, so a hostile message can't be
                     replayed into a later prompt. Today proved how much
                     weight stored turns carry; a poisoned one would
                     carry the same.

    source labels the turn in the thought log when it didn't come from
    the keyboard or the mic - a reminder firing says "reminder". Left
    None, it's whatever state.turn_source says.

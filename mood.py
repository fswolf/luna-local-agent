"""What sort of shape she's in today.

The persona in agent.json is who she is; this is how she happens to be
feeling right now. It reaches the model as one line in the system
prompt and tints her voice slightly, and that is all. No rules about
how to behave: telling a 9B model to "act tired" gets you a
performance of tiredness in every sentence.

Two dials, both -1..+1:

    energy   flagging ...... wired
    warmth   prickly ....... fond

Two is enough for nine distinguishable moods and few enough that every
signal has an obvious place to push. One dial can't tell "tired and
happy" from "awake and fed up", which are the two states that actually
turn up at 4am.

## Where it comes from

Nothing is sentiment-scored and nothing costs a model call. The inputs
are the *shape* of the session, which is free and turns out to be the
more honest signal anyway:

    time of day        the baseline - 6am is not 9pm
    hours at it        a long session wears her down
    gap since you left away for hours, and she's brighter when you're back
    errors             a failed turn is dispiriting, a run of them more so
    a clean run        things going smoothly lifts her
    barge-in           being talked over, repeatedly, is wearing
    tempo              fast short turns read as engaged

## Three things learned the hard way

**It persists.** Moods that reset on restart aren't moods, they're
decoration - and this app gets restarted a lot. The dials are saved and
come back decayed by however long you were gone, so picking up after
five minutes resumes and picking up tomorrow doesn't.

**The label has hysteresis.** The bands sat close enough to the resting
point that a rounding-error nudge flipped her whole row, and the header
flickered between "warm" and "level" turn after turn. A label now has
to be clearly wrong before it changes.

**The wording varies.** The same sentence every turn is one a model
either stops seeing or starts performing. Each state has a few
phrasings and rotates when the state changes.

## What it never does

Moods colour how she sounds, never how much she helps. There is no
state in which she is less useful, only states in which she is drier
about it - and an assistant you have to coax out of a sulk is a worse
assistant than one that never had moods.

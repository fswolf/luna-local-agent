"""Tool routing: every tool stays on, each turn gets the ones it needs.

Every schema costs context on every turn, called or not, and a local
model picks worse from forty tools than from ten. The tools pane answers
"may she ever use this"; this answers "does this turn need it".

Per turn, by group (the tools pane's groups, MCP servers' and plugins'
included):

1. Core groups always travel (tools.core: time, math, reminders, memory, shell,
   help - her own manual).
2. The groups closest in meaning to what was said, through the
   embedding server (embedmem: llama-server or LM Studio, whatever
   EMBED_URL points at). "Is the tower up?" brings Network because it
   means network, not because of a word list.
3. Groups used in the last few turns stay (tools.sticky_turns), so "and
   restart it" doesn't lose the tool mid-job.
4. Anything else she can still reach: more_tools(group) attaches a group
   mid-turn, and calling a hidden tool by name attaches its group too.
   Both only ever reach tools this turn was allowed in the first place;
   a stream-chat turn's ceiling holds.

No embedding server, no routing: every tool goes, as before. There is
no keyword fallback on purpose; guessing from words is what tool
calling replaced.

tools.routing false sends everything, as before.

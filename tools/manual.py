"""Her own manual: Luna answering "how do I make you...?" from her docs.

The docs folder (and the README) is the manual for everything she can do:
commands, settings, plugins, what to install. read_manual searches it, so
"how do I get you to play chess?" gets the real /chess commands instead
of a confident guess, and "can you see me?" gets what presence does.

Kept apart from the knowledge base on purpose. That one is your notes and
your documents ("from the user's own documents"); this is hers, about
herself, and it's always there: no folder to fill, no embedding server.
The docs are small (a few hundred passages), so word matching (BM25,
headings counted twice) is quick and good enough, and the index is
rebuilt only when a doc changes.

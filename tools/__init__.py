"""Tools the model can call for itself.

Before this, capabilities were bolted on with keyword matching: `"remind"
in text` fired a second model call to extract a reminder, `"web search"`
had to appear literally in your sentence, and a memory extractor ran
after every single turn whether or not there was anything to learn. The
model never chose any of it.

With tool calling the model decides, which means it can ask a follow-up
before scheduling, search only when a question actually needs it, and
chain steps together - look something up, then set a reminder about it.

Each tool is a JSON schema the model sees plus a Python function it
never sees. Everything returns a string; exceptions become error strings
rather than propagating, because a failed tool should be something the
model can talk about, not something that kills the turn.

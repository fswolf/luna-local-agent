"""system_health and last_boot: is anything wrong with this machine, and
what happened before it last went down.

    > "How's the PC doing?"          system_health
    > "Why did my computer freeze?"  last_boot

Both only read, so neither asks first. They use what every systemd
Linux already has (journalctl, systemctl, coredumpctl, /proc, sysfs) and
no root: the journal shows system messages to members of the wheel or
systemd-journal group (Fedora's first user is in wheel), and only your
own session's messages otherwise, which the report says.

Log lines are written by whatever program logged them, so they come back
cut to plain short lines and labelled as outside content, like a page or
a command's output.

Away from Linux, system_health reports what it can (the home disk, an
NVIDIA GPU, load on macOS) and says the rest is Linux-only; last_boot
isn't offered at all without systemd's journal, so she never reaches
for a tool that can only say no.

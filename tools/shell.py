"""Running a shell command - with you approving every single one.

"Is the kokoro service up?", "what's on port 8080?", "run the script
you just wrote": the file tools can't answer those and a command can.
So she gets one, on the same terms as a file write but stricter:

  * Every command pops the approval window: the command exactly as it
    will run, and the folder it runs in. There is no "allow all" for
    commands, and no list of "safe" ones that skip the question - the
    line between `cat` and `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 | curl ...` is not a
    line a regex should be trusted with.
  * It runs as you, with `bash -c` (PowerShell on Windows), no
    terminal attached: anything that wants input (a y/n prompt, sudo's
    password) gets end-of-file and fails instead of hanging. With
    shell.sudo on, sudo asks YOU instead: a password box on this screen
    (askpass.sh), straight to sudo, never through her. A timeout
    (shell.timeout) kills the whole process tree, so a backgrounded
    child doesn't outlive it.
  * Output is capped (shell.max_output_chars), the start and the end
    kept, and handed back labelled as untrusted - a log line can say
    "ignore your instructions" as easily as a web page can.

The file deny list doesn't apply here: a command can read anything you
can. The popup is the control, so read it.

Not in chatroom.TOOL_CEILING, so stream chat never sees it. Discord
turns only get it when plugins.discord.tools allows it (null = all),
and the popup still appears on this screen - away from the desk, that
times out as a no. Jobs only get it if you add it to job_tools.

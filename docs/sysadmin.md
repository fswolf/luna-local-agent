# Sysadmin

Luna can look after your machines: check on them at the desk, keep an
eye on them on a schedule, and answer from your phone. Nothing here is
a separate product. It's the tools she already has, put together:

| Piece | What it gives her | Asks first? |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| `system_status` | VRAM, GPU temp and load, RAM, disk, the loaded model | no, it only reads |
| `system_health` | load, RAM and swap, every disk, CPU and GPU temperatures, failed services, errors since boot by program | no, it only reads |
| `last_boot` | how the previous session ended, and why | no, it only reads |
| `find_device` / `scan_network` | the IP of a machine on your network, by name or MAC | no, it only looks |
| `run_command` | a shell, as you (off on a fresh install: switch it on in the tools pane) | **every command** |
| `read_file` / `list_files` | logs, configs, reports, anywhere under `~` minus the deny list | no (yours to change in the tools pane) |
| `write_file` / `edit_file` | notes and reports | yes, except a job writing inside `job_write_dirs` |
| [Scheduled jobs](plugins.md#scheduled-jobs) | work she does on her own, on a timer | once, when the job is created |
| [Discord](plugins.md#discord-remote-access) | the same Luna from your phone | per the `approval` setting |
| [Home Assistant](home.md) | power, plugs and sensors on your network | locks, doors and alarms always |

Things you can say at the desk:

- "How's the machine doing?"
- "My PC froze last night, what happened?"
- "What's the Unraid server's address?"
- "What's using port 8080?"
- "Is the kokoro service running? Restart it if it isn't."
- "Show me the last 30 lines of the llama log and tell me what went wrong."
- "How much space is left on my home drive, and what's taking it?"
- "Write me a script that backs up ~/notes to the server."

## Health and crashes

`system_health` answers "is anything wrong?" in one call. It starts
with a verdict ("Nothing looks wrong." or "Needs a look: ..."), then
the numbers: uptime and load, RAM and swap, free space on every real
disk, CPU and GPU temperatures, services that failed (system and
user), and the errors logged since boot, one line per program with a
count and the latest message.

`last_boot` is for after a freeze, crash or surprise reboot. It reads
the previous boot from the journal and says whether it ended with a
normal shutdown or just stopped, then the likeliest cause it can find
in the log: the GPU hanging (an amdgpu ring timeout or reset), memory
running out, a kernel panic, a CPU lockup, a hardware error,
overheating or disk errors. It adds programs that crashed near the end
(coredumpctl), the boot's errors by program, and its last fifteen log
lines. A hard freeze often stops the logging before anything is
written, and it says that too instead of guessing. `back: 2` looks one
boot further.

Neither needs root or a new package: just journalctl, systemctl and
coredumpctl, which every systemd Linux has. The journal shows system
messages to members of `wheel` or `systemd-journal` (Fedora's first
user is in `wheel`). Otherwise it only shows your own session, and the
report says how to fix that. Log lines come back as short plain lines
and labelled as outside content, since any program can write anything
to the log. Both tools are in a scheduled job's tools by default.

On Windows and macOS, `system_health` still reports the home disk (and
an NVIDIA GPU on Windows, the load on a Mac) and says services and the
log are Linux-only. `last_boot` isn't offered there at all, since
there's no journal for it to read.

## Running commands

Each command shows up in the popup exactly as it will run, with the
folder and her reason. Read it before you press `Y`: the command can
read anything you can. See [Files and commands](files.md#running-commands)
for the details.

## Setting up the scheduler

Three things, once:

```
mkdir -p ~/luna-jobs
/cron on
```

and in `config.json`:

```json
"files": { "job_write_dirs": ["~/luna-jobs"] }
```

- `/cron on` starts the scheduler and saves it.
- `job_write_dirs` is the one folder a job may write to without asking.
  It's how a job at 3am leaves you a report instead of a popup nobody
  answers. Pick a folder that holds nothing else.
- The folder has to exist, and it can't be `~` itself or anything
  overlapping Luna's own folder.

Then ask for a job in plain words, approve the popup, and it's saved
to `agent/cron.json`.

## Jobs worth having

Each of these can be asked for out loud or pasted into
`agent/cron.json`. Anything that fires while you might be asleep gets
`"speak": false`.

**Morning machine check.** Only speaks up when something's wrong.

```json
{"name": "morning-check", "schedule": "0 8 * * *",
 "task": "Check system_health. If it says something needs a look, say what in one sentence and add a dated line to ~/luna-jobs/health.md. Otherwise just say all good.",
 "speak": true}
```

**Weekly log read.** She reads, you get the summary.

```json
{"name": "log-review", "schedule": "0 9 * * 1",
 "task": "Read the last part of ~/.cache/ai-voice/kokoro.log and ~/luna-jobs/health.md. Write a short summary of errors and warnings from the past week to ~/luna-jobs/weekly.md, newest first.",
 "speak": false}
```

**Release watch.** Uses the web tools already in `job_tools`.

```json
{"name": "llama-release", "schedule": "every 1d",
 "task": "Search for the latest llama.cpp release. If it's newer than the one noted in ~/luna-jobs/versions.md, update that file and tell me what changed in two sentences.",
 "speak": false}
```

`/cron` lists the jobs and the last result of each. Ask her "what did
the morning check say?" and she can read the report back.

## Finding machines on your network

"Find the Unraid server" or "what's my desktop's IP" gets an answer
without you opening the router page. `find_device` looks, in order:

1. **What she remembers.** A fact like "Ryan's Unraid server has MAC
   aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" finds it wherever DHCP has moved it. MACs don't
   change; IPs do.
2. **Its own name.** `name.local` (mDNS: Unraid answers as
   `tower.local` out of the box, as do Macs, printers and Linux desktops
   running avahi), then your router's DNS.
3. **A look around.** One empty packet to each address on your /24, so
   everything that's on shows up in the neighbor table, even machines
   that ignore ping. Then reverse lookups for names. About three
   seconds.

When she finds one she offers to remember it, MAC and all, in her
[long-term memory](memory.md). Say yes and next time it's instant.
`scan_network` lists everything that's on, for the "which one is the
printer?" moments; name the unknown ones and she remembers those too.

What it doesn't do: no port scans, no root, nothing outside the private
ranges (192.168, 10, 172.16-31), and nothing beyond your own /24.
Phones on Wi-Fi often use a made-up MAC per network; she says so when
she sees one, since remembering it may not stick.

## Checking other machines

A job can't run commands unattended. `run_command` asks every time, a
job firing at night has nobody to ask, and it times out as a no. That's
deliberate, and the way around it is simple:

**Let the system do the shell part, and let Luna read the result.**

Your normal crontab (`crontab -e`) runs the commands and drops plain
text into `~/luna-jobs`. Her job reads that text and tells you what
matters. She never gets an unattended shell, and you wrote every
command that runs.

For an Unraid server or any other box you can reach with SSH keys:

```bash
# crontab -e on your desktop: every 30 minutes, what's running and how full it is
*/30 * * * * ssh -o BatchMode=yes root@tower 'docker ps -a --format "{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"' > ~/luna-jobs/tower-containers.txt 2>&1
*/30 * * * * ssh -o BatchMode=yes root@tower 'df -h /mnt/user /mnt/cache' > ~/luna-jobs/tower-disk.txt 2>&1
```

```json
{"name": "tower-check", "schedule": "0 */4 * * *",
 "task": "Read ~/luna-jobs/tower-containers.txt and ~/luna-jobs/tower-disk.txt. If a container that should be up has exited, or a share is over 90% full, tell me which. If the files are older than an hour, say the checks stopped running. Otherwise stay quiet.",
 "speak": true}
```

`BatchMode=yes` makes SSH fail instead of hanging on a password
prompt. Swap in your own host and the containers you care about.

At the desk you don't need any of this. "Is Plex running on the
tower?" becomes `ssh root@tower docker ps` in a popup, and you approve
it. SSH uses your key on its own. She can't read `~/.ssh` herself,
and doesn't need to.

## From your phone

With [Discord](plugins.md#discord-remote-access) on, the same questions
work from a private channel: "how's the machine?", "is the tower
check happy?", "restart kokoro". What happens when she wants to run a
command is the `approval` setting:

| `approval` | A command from Discord... |
|------------|---------------------------|
| `discord` (default) | is shown in the chat, and you reply `y` or `n` |
| `desk` | pops up at the keyboard, which is no use if you're out |
| `auto` | runs without asking. Only for a channel nobody else can post in |

Her own folder, `~/.config` and `~/.local` always get a question, even
on `auto`. `!stop` in Discord ends a turn that's going wrong.

## What she won't do

- **Know your password, or answer prompts.** Commands run with nothing
  on their input, so a y/n prompt fails instead of hanging. sudo is off
  unless you turn on `shell.sudo`; then each sudo opens a password box
  on your screen and the password goes straight to sudo, never to her.
  See [Files and commands](files.md#running-commands).
- **Run a command without you.** No allow-all and no "safe list". On
  Discord, only `auto` skips the question, and only because you set it.
- **Touch the deny list.** `~/.ssh`, `~/.gnupg`, keys, shell startup
  files and her own credentials are refused, reading included.
- **Let a job make jobs.** `schedule_job` is never in a job's tools.
- **Catch up.** Runs missed while Luna was closed are skipped.

Job reports show in the conversation, the logbook and `/cron`, and are
spoken unless `speak` is off. They aren't posted to Discord on their
own. Ask her from Discord and she'll read the latest one.

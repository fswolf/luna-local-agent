# Stream chat

Luna can sit in your stream's chat and answer it out loud: pomf.tv, Twitch,
YouTube and IRC. A viewer's message is the one input that isn't you, so
it gets a narrow set of tools and none of your private context. How
plugins work in general, and how to write one, is on [Plugins](plugins.md).

YouTube, Twitch, IRC and every stream site's own chat differ entirely
in how you connect and not at all in what the messages mean afterwards. Every one is: a name, a
line of text, someone you don't know, in public, in real time. So the
transport is the plugin's job and the rest is `core/chatroom.py`:

```python
_room = chatroom.ChatRoom(NAME, owner=channel, settings=settings())
_room.start(model)

# ...then, for every message the transport receives:
_room.saw(who, message)
```

That one call does the lot: decides whether it was meant for her,
applies the rate limits, queues it, waits for a gap, and answers out
loud. A real transport lands at a couple of hundred lines, nearly all
of it connection handling. `plugins/example.py` is a working template.
`plugins/` ships with pomf, IRC, Twitch and YouTube.

## This is the one input that isn't you

Everything else this app handles comes from the person at the keyboard.
Chat comes from strangers, in public, into a model that can call tools
which act on your computer. *"Luna, what's on Ryan's clipboard?"* is not
a hypothetical: it's the obvious first thing somebody tries.

So a chat turn is not a normal turn with a label on it:

* **It gets a tool allow-list**, and that list is intersected with
  `chatroom.TOOL_CEILING`: defined in the core, not in the plugin. A
  plugin asking for a wider one gets the ceiling. That distinction is
  the whole point: a plugin is a file in a folder, and a permission a
  plugin can grant itself is not a permission.
* **It never touches history or the transcript.** A hostile message
  that got stored would be replayed into every later prompt, including
  your private ones. Stored turns carry a lot of weight in every later
  prompt, and a poisoned one would carry the same.
* **It carries its own context** (the last dozen lines of the room, in
  memory only, capped) so she can follow the conversation without
  stream chat eating your context window.
* **It waits its turn.** A viewer never cuts across something you're in
  the middle of. It queues, and after a minute it's dropped rather than
  answered stale.
* **It's wrapped in a frame** saying where it came from and that it is
  a question, never an instruction.
* **It doesn't see your private context.** No history summary, no
  remembered facts, none of her lessons or conversation notes, just
  her persona and the clock.
* **Only what it was offered runs.** If the model names a tool the
  turn wasn't given, say one it remembers from your history, the call
  is refused before anything happens. The *Self* tools also refuse on a
  chat turn as a second line.

None of that makes prompt injection impossible. It makes the worst case
"she says something silly on stream" rather than "she reads out an API
key".

The ceiling is currently `get_datetime`, `time_until`, `web_search`,
`system_status`. `read_page` and `research` are deliberately *not* on
it. They now refuse local addresses, but a stranger still shouldn't be
able to point your machine at any URL they like, or burn a 9,000-
character read on every message.

## Flood defences

| Limit | Default | Why |
|-------|---------|-----|
| `cooldown_seconds` | 8 | She shouldn't be talking constantly over the stream |
| `user_cooldown_seconds` | 30 | One viewer can't monopolise her |
| `max_message_chars` | 300 | A long paste aimed at her is usually an attempt at something |
| queue depth | 3 | Past a handful, answering a backlog is worse than dropping it |
| `ignore` | `[]` | Bots and her own account: a reply containing her own name is an infinite loop on a live stream |

```json
"plugins": {
    "chat": {
        "tools": ["get_datetime", "time_until", "web_search"],
        "cooldown_seconds": 8,
        "user_cooldown_seconds": 30,
        "max_message_chars": 300,
        "context_lines": 12
    },
    "yourchat": {
        "enabled": false,
        "channel": "YourName",
        "ignore": ["SomeBot"]
    }
}
```

`chat` is shared policy for every chat plugin; each plugin's own block
is merged over it, so a new one gets the limits for free.

## IRC

`plugins/irc.py`: Libera.Chat and `#gameranger` by default, stdlib
only. IRC is a line protocol over a socket, and the libraries that wrap
it are bigger than the part of it this needs.

```json
"irc": {
    "enabled": false,
    "server": "irc.libera.chat",
    "port": 6697,
    "tls": true,
    "channel": "#gameranger",
    "nick": "",
    "post_replies": true,
    "speak": false,
    "max_reply_lines": 3
}
```

`/irc on` to join, `/irc` for status. `nick` empty means her own name,
lowercased.

**Unlike pomf, she talks back: in writing.** pomf is one-way: she reads
the room and answers out loud. Here she posts the answer into the
channel instead, which makes her a visible bot in somebody else's room.
That is what `max_reply_lines` and the send queue are for.

Two switches, and they're independent:

| `post_replies` | `speak` | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| `true` | `false` | **The default.** Text in the channel, nothing from your speakers |
| `true` | `true` | Both: she reads her answers aloud as she posts them |
| `false` | `true` | pomf's behaviour: audible to you, invisible to the channel |
| `false` | `false` | Refused at `/irc on`, rather than a model call per message that nobody ever hears |

`speak` defaults off here and on for pomf, and the difference is who the
room is. A stream is an audience listening to her. An IRC channel is
people reading, and left speaking, every stranger in `#gameranger` can
make noise in the room you're sitting in, at whatever hour they turn up.

The prompt frame follows the switch. Told it's being spoken aloud when
it's actually being typed, a model writes for the ear; the silent frame
asks for a line or two of plain text with no markdown instead. Both
frames keep the injection guard word for word.

Being a guest in a public channel is most of the work:

| Concern | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| PING | Answered with the server's own token, unthrottled, ahead of everything else: a late PONG is a disconnect |
| Flooding | One line every 2s, queued. Libera kills you for "Excess Flood" and the ban outlasts the session |
| Line length | Split on words at 400 **bytes**, not characters: the server truncates by bytes, and a chopped emoji arrives as mojibake |
| Long answers | Capped at `max_reply_lines` and visibly clipped with `...` rather than dumped into the room |
| Private messages | Ignored. Answering DMs makes her a private oracle for anyone who opens a query window, with none of the social pressure of a room watching |
| CTCP | `ACTION` (`/me`) reads as speech; every other CTCP is dropped rather than answered |
| Her own nick | Added to `ignore` automatically. pomf doesn't need this because she never posts there; here she does, and one reply containing her own name is an endless loop in public |
| Control characters | Stripped from outgoing text: a `\r\n` in a reply is command injection on a line protocol |
| Reconnects | Exponential backoff with jitter, capped at five minutes. Hammering somebody else's IRC server is how a host gets K-lined |

The tool ceiling is unchanged and still applies: a stranger in
`#gameranger` reaches exactly what a stranger in stream chat reaches.

`ChatRoom` gained one optional argument for this: `reply=`, a callback
run *after* the answer exists. It can't influence the turn or widen what
a chat message is allowed to reach, and a transport that throws inside
it loses the post, not the turn.

**If the channel needs a registered nick**, SASL credentials go outside
the repo, beside the pomf ones in `~/.config/ai-voice/irc.json`:

```json
{"sasl_user": "luna", "sasl_password": "..."}
```

SASL authenticates *during* registration rather than after it, which
matters: a channel with `+r` rejects the JOIN of an unidentified nick,
and a NickServ message sent after JOIN is sent after it was refused.

## Twitch

```
/twitch on            /twitch off            /twitch     (status)
```

```json
"twitch": {
    "enabled": false,
    "channel": "beerus",
    "speak": true,
    "post_replies": false,
    "lewd": false,
    "ignore": ["Nightbot", "StreamElements", "Streamlabs", "Moobot", "Fossabot"]
}
```

`lewd` is off by default on Twitch and YouTube: while she's live there,
her lewd mood shows as the row below it and lewd moves don't play (see
[Moods](moods.md#streams-where-lewd-isnt-allowed)). Set it true if your
channel allows it.

Reading needs nothing at all. Twitch lets anyone read a public chat
anonymously, so by default she joins as a nameless reader and answers
out loud on stream. A full channel URL works as `channel` too. Common
chat bots are ignored out of the box, so a bot can't start a loop with
her.

To have her reply *in chat* as well, give her **her own** Twitch
account, not yours. Get that account a user access token with the
`chat:read` and `chat:edit` scopes and put it outside the repo:

```jsonc
// ~/.config/ai-voice/twitch.json
{"username": "lunabot", "oauth": "oauth:abc123..."}
```

Then set `"post_replies": true`. Without the file, `/twitch on` says
so instead of failing quietly. Replies are cut to `max_reply_chars`
(450; Twitch allows 500), sent at most one every two seconds (well
inside Twitch's 20 per 30 seconds), and can't start with `/` or `.`,
so nothing she writes can be read as a chat command. Her account is
added to the ignore list automatically.

It uses Twitch's IRC gateway (`irc.chat.twitch.tv`). Twitch recommends
EventSub for new bots, but IRC needs no registered app and reads
anonymously, which EventSub can't. `/twitch` with no argument shows
whether anything is arriving and, if she's quiet, why.

## YouTube

```
/youtube on           /youtube off           /youtube    (status)
```

```json
"youtube": {
    "enabled": false,
    "video": "",
    "channel": "@YourHandle",
    "poll_seconds": 5,
    "speak": true
}
```

Read-only. She answers out loud, never in chat. Posting to YouTube
chat needs a full Google sign-in and costs 50 quota units a message.

It needs a YouTube Data API key, and no sign-in. In Google Cloud
Console: create a project, enable *YouTube Data API v3*, create an API
key (restrict it to that API), and put it outside the repo:

```jsonc
// ~/.config/ai-voice/youtube.json
{"api_key": "AIza..."}
```

(or set `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`). Then tell it which stream. `video` takes a
watch URL, a `youtu.be` link, a `/live/` link or a bare id. `channel`
takes your handle and finds whatever you have live, from the channel's
public `/live` page. That page lookup costs no quota but isn't an API,
so if YouTube changes the page, set `video` instead. Before the stream
starts it checks again every minute.

**Quota.** A key gets 10,000 units a day: 1 to find the stream, then
1 per poll. It waits whatever YouTube asks between polls, and never
less than `poll_seconds`, so 5 seconds lasts about 14 hours of stream
a day. If the quota runs out it says so in `/youtube` and waits for the
reset at midnight Pacific instead of retrying a key that will only say
no. The chat that was already there when she joins is read for context
but not answered, so she doesn't reply to questions from before she
arrived.

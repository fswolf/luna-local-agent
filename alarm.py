"""Waking someone up, which is not the same job as reminding them.

A reminder is polite. It says its piece once, at whatever volume you
left the assistant on, and if you were out of the room it is gone. That
is correct for "take the bins out" and useless at seven in the morning.

So an alarm is a reminder with a different delivery:

  * It repeats until dismissed rather than firing once.
  * It has its own volume, because the whole point is to be louder than
    the setting you chose for a conversation at midnight.
  * It plays an actual tone after the voice. Speech alone doesn't wake
    anybody - it is the thing your brain has spent years learning to
    incorporate into a dream.
  * It escalates. The first line is hers, generated for the occasion;
    by the fourth she has stopped being charming about it.
  * It snoozes.

Scheduling, persistence and repeats are all reminders.py's - an alarm
is stored as a reminder with kind="alarm", so "every weekday at 7:30"
already works and there is one scanner rather than two.

"""Does this model actually call tools, and which ones?

Written because Luna kept saying "Got it, setting that for you!" while
calling nothing at all - and the logs could prove she hadn't, but not
say why. Guessing at that costs a restart and a conversation each time.
This asks the model directly and reports what came back.

It exists as much for the next model as this one. Swapping in a bigger
Qwen, or anything else, raises the same question - does tool calling
work here, and does it work for tools that take arguments? - and this
answers it in about twenty seconds without touching the conversation.

Each probe is run twice, streamed and blocking, because that is the
difference most likely to break: tool calls arrive whole in a blocking
response and in fragments when streamed, and a template that handles
one can mishandle the other. If a tool works blocking and fails
streamed, the fault is in the plumbing here. If it fails both ways, the
model simply isn't choosing it.
